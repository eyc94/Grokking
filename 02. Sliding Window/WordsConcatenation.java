Words Concatenation [HARD]

Given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substrings in the
given string that are a concatenation of all the given words exactly once without any
overlapping of words. It is given that all words are of the same length.

--- EXAMPLES ---

- EX 1 -
Input:          String = "catfoxcat", Words = ["cat", "fox"]
Output:         [0, 3]
Explanation:    The two substring containing both the words are "catfox" & "foxcat".

- EX 2 -
Input:          String = "catcatfoxfox", Words = ["cat", "fox"]
Output:         [3]
Explanation:    The only substring containing both the words is "catfox".
