/*
Dutch National Flag Problem [MEDIUM]

Given an array containing 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of
the array as objects, hence, we can't count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white, and blue; and since our input
array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called "Dutch National Flag
Problem".

--- EXAMPLES ---

- EX 1 -
Input:          [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output:         [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]

- EX 2 -
Input:          [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output:         [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
