# Introduction
- Problems solved in Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript.
- Need an understanding of common data-structures like Array, LinkedList, HashMap, Stack, Queue, Heap, and Graph.
- Need familiarity with Recursion and Big-Oh.

## Overview
- There are 16 patterns.
- Around 150 problems mapped to 16 patterns.
- We use Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve problems related to Trees and Graphs.
- We cover Dynamic Programming (DP), Backtracking, Recursion, Greedy Algorithms, and Divide & Conquer.
- Starts with brief introduction of each pattern.
