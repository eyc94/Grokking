# Introduction to Merge Intervals

- Efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals.
- In a lot of problems with intervals, we need to find overlapping intervals.
- Or, merge intervals if they overlap.
- Given two intervals `a` and `b`, there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other.
