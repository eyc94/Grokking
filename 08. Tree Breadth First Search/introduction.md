# Introduction to Tree Breadth First Search

- Based on the `Breadth First Search (BFS)` technique to traverse a tree.
- Any problem involving traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order.
- Use a `Queue` to keep track of all the nodes of a level before going to the next.
- Space complexity is O(W) where 'W' is the max number of nodes on any level.
