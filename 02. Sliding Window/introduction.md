# Introduction to Sliding Window
- In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.
- For example:

`Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size 'K' in it.`

- Real input:
```
Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2], K = 5
```
